            <li>Laugh, even if it’s forced. It’s true what they say: laughter is the best medicine. A good chuckle stimulates circulation and soothes tension in your body. Laughter is also known to reduce levels of stress hormones including cortisol, epinephrine and dopamine. So, it’s scientific! Tell a joke, make a funny face or fake laugh until it turns into uncontrollable laughter. We dare you to try it!</li>
            <li>Meditate for 10 minutes. Simple meditation doesn’t take long at all and can help you control stress, improve relaxation and decrease anxiety. You’ve definitely heard this stress relief tip before, but following these simple instructions will make it seem less intimidating. Whether sitting or standing, close your eyes and simply focus on your breath. Think about the act of filling and depleting your lungs with air and try not to let your attention stray. After 10 minutes of deep focus, you might be surprised at the benefits you’ll feel from setting an intention and creating a place to quiet your mind.</li>
            <li>Dance like nobody’s watching. You might not be home alone, but convince your family to join in on the fun too! Challenge your kids or significant other to a dance off and create routines that can be performed right in your living room. If you’d like to do something a little less formal, put on your favorite song and just start moving and grooving. Once those endorphins kick in, you’ll be feeling better in no time, when the body feels good the mind does too.</li>
            <li>Create a “gratitude sandwich.” This isn’t a typical sandwich you’d have for lunch, but it’s definitely a great one to start serving up. Sandwich one thing that is going wrong between two things that you are grateful for. Write them down or say them allowed to really focus in on the good things in your life. In a world where most of us spend too much time in our own minds with negative thoughts, it’s important to challenge these and get on the road to feeling better. Who’s ready for a sub?</li>
